I often enjoy viewing the source code of websites. It's just my curious nature. Anyways, I decided to create this script because I would often run into situtations where I am viewing a CSS file, but the file is "compressed" in the sense that the newline characters are removed. So, I wrote this quick script to parse the offending CSS file and create a more aesthetically pleasing human-readable version.
